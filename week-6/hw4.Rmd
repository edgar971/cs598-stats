## Question 2 (50 Points) Write `R` Functions

Write an R function that outputs the first $n$ terms in the Fibonacci sequence, where $n$ is the only input value of the function. 

### Answer: 

```{r}

  fibonacci <- function(n)
  {
    x = numeric(n)
    x[1:2] = c(1,1)
    for(i in 3:n) x[i] = x[i-1] + x[i-2]
    return(x)
  }

  # test the function 
  fibonacci(10)
```
